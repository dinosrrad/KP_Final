                        Buttercup is a mental health subscription box designed to assist users in managing anxiety in three different fields of their lives. This process gave me the opportunity to build out a minor brand and design packaging for items that would be contained within each box. It covers three pillars of need: Self, Social, and Sleep. This allows users to cater their subscription needs to different areas of their life, rather than guessing if the items in the box will be beneficial to them each time.

                        The branding for Buttercup took on a more minimal approach, allowing the illustrations to shine on the packaging. The secondary set of colors was dedicated to each pillar of support, allowing users to find items quickly when they need them most. The main color palette is used exclulsively for the outside of the box and for text, ensuring that the brand standards stay consistent through social media concepts and shipped items.

                        The final images showcase the larger Buttercup box that each pillar of items comes in, as well as some of the smaller items and coordinating packaging. This process included narrowing down what items that would be the most beneficial in each setting to best accommodate anxiety and the range of symptoms individuals might face when looking to manage them.
